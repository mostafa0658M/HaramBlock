Haram Block is an Android application that blurs or completely blocks inappropriate images (such as those containing women) ‚Äî similar to the Haram Blur browser extension ‚Äî but for the entire device, not just the browser.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The app processes the screen in several stages:

1. Accessibility Service

Detects image frame positions on the screen.

Passes coordinates to the next stages.

Uses Cache to avoid reprocessing every frame.



2. Media Projection

Takes a screenshot.

Crops image frames using coordinates from the accessibility service.



3. JNI + NCNN

JNI allows running C++ libraries in Java apps.

NCNN is a fast, lightweight AI inference library for ARM processors.



4. Image Processing

Crops and prepares images for analysis.



5. Face Detection

Uses a lightweight slim-128 model (~1MB).

Detection speed: 5‚Äì12ms per image.



6. Gender Classification

Custom PyTorch model converted to NCNN.

Speed: 0.3‚Äì1.5ms per face.



7. Blocking Mechanism

Draws a black box over inappropriate images instead of reapplying blur, saving resources.

üõ†Ô∏è Suggestions for Improvement

Improve UI design.

Add Safe Apps feature.

Allow users to choose between models based on device performance and battery usage.

Add statistics on blocked images.

Create an iOS version (using MNN library).

Optimize battery and memory usage.

Speed up detection and rendering algorithms.

Improve AI models.

Make a promotional video (without music or inappropriate scenes).

Expand and enhance the documentation.
