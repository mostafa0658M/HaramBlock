# Haram Block App üõ°Ô∏è
**Haram Block** is an innovative mobile application designed to protect users from viewing inappropriate images (those containing women's faces) by applying a blur or block effect. Inspired by the **Haram Blur** extension, this app leverages advanced AI techniques to deliver a seamless and efficient experience on smartphones.

The app aims to create a safe browsing environment while maintaining high performance and low battery consumption. It utilizes cutting-edge technologies such as face detection and gender classification, combined with an intuitive user interface.

## How to Install the App (as a Developer)
If you‚Äôre a developer looking to install or contribute to **Haram Block**, follow these steps:
1. Open a terminal on your system.
2. Run the following commands to clone and set up the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/HaramBlock.git
cd HaramBlock
```

3. Execute the setup script for your operating system:
   - **For Linux/macOS**:
     ```bash
     ./setup.sh
     ```
   - **For Windows**:
     ```bash
     .\setup.bat
     ```

4. Ensure the following prerequisites are installed:
   - **JDK 17** (Java Development Kit).
   - **Android SDK** (available through Android Studio).
   - Build tools like Gradle.

> **Note**: The setup process may take time if JDK 17 or Android SDK is not already installed. Ensure these are set up before running the script.

## How the App Works
**Haram Block** operates through a series of technical stages to achieve its functionality. Below is an overview with a visual representation:

```
üì± Accessibility Service
        ‚Üì
üì∏ Media Projection (Screen Capture)
        ‚Üì
üîÑ JNI (C++) + NCNN Framework
        ‚Üì
üñºÔ∏è Image Preprocessing
        ‚Üì
üòä Face Detection (Slim-128 Model)
        ‚Üì
üë©‚Äçü¶∞ Gender Classification (Custom Model)
        ‚Üì
üõë Block Inappropriate Images
```

### 1. **Accessibility Service**
The app uses the **Accessibility Service** to detect the coordinates of image frames displayed on the screen. These coordinates are used to identify images for further processing. Caching techniques are employed to avoid redundant processing, improving performance.

### 2. **Media Projection**
The **Media Projection** API allows the app to capture screenshots securely. Using the coordinates from the Accessibility Service, the app crops relevant image frames from the screen.

### 3. **JNI + NCNN**
- **JNI (Java Native Interface)**: Enables the integration of C++ libraries within Java-based Android apps, facilitating the use of advanced libraries like NCNN.
- **NCNN**: A lightweight, high-performance framework optimized for ARM processors, used to run AI models efficiently on mobile devices.

### 4. **Image Preprocessing**
Images are prepared for analysis by resizing, enhancing quality, and removing unnecessary noise, ensuring compatibility with AI models.

### 5. **Face Detection**
The app employs the **Slim-128** model (open-source) for face detection. This lightweight model (approximately 1 MB) processes images in **5-12 milliseconds**.

> **Model Link**: [Slim-128 Face Detection](https://github.com/ultralight-face-detection).

### 6. **Gender Classification**
A custom **PyTorch** model, converted to **NCNN**, is used to classify the gender of detected faces. It is highly optimized, processing each face in **0.3-1.5 milliseconds**.

> **AI Models Link**: [AI Models](https://example.com/ai).

### 7. **Block Mechanism**
Upon detecting an inappropriate image, the app draws a black rectangle over it instead of applying a blur effect to minimize resource usage, ensuring smooth performance.
